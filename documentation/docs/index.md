## About Us
We are a group of four dedicated individuals united by our passion for environmental sustainability and data science. Our team, known as **WeDon’tHallucinate**, is excited to work on the WaterLevels Oker project, which focuses on predicting the water levels of the German river Oker. By leveraging advanced data analysis and machine learning techniques, we aim to provide accurate and timely water level forecasts. These predictions are vital for flood management and environmental protection.

At AquaStream, we believe in the power of data to drive meaningful change. Our mission is to create reliable tools that can assist various stakeholders in making informed decisions to protect and manage water resources effectively.

## Our Idea
We are working on predicting the water levels of the Oker River using weather climate data and sensor-measured water levels to generate an AI model that can predict water levels accurately and warn about flooding and other parameters. We will employ supervised learning techniques to predict water levels based on climate characteristics. The final goal will be to develop a web app/mobile app that can be used independently and extensively by the administration of Braunschweig city to effectively monitor and prevent any mishaps or adverse flooding effects.
