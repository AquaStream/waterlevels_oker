We are developing an AI model to predict the Oker River water levels using weather data and sensor measurements. Using supervised learning, the model aims to accurately forecast water levels and provide flood warnings. The ultimate goal is to create a web/mobile app for Braunschweig city administration to monitor and prevent flooding effectively.
